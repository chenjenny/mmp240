	<h1> DESCRIPTION</h1>
	<div class="bull">
		<P>The 7,100 pound sculpture stands 11 feet tall and measures 16 feet long. The oversize sculpture depicts a bull, the symbol of aggressive financial optimism and prosperity, leaning back on its haunches and with its head lowered as if ready to charge. The sculpture is both a popular tourist destination which draws thousands of people a day, as well as "one of the most iconic images of New York" and a "Wall Street icon" symbolizing Wall Street and the Financial District.</P>

		<h1>FEARLESS GIRL</h1>
		<div class="girl">
			<img src="girl.png" width="800px">
			<p>On March 7, 2017, the night before International Women's Day, another bronze sculpture, Fearless Girl, was placed directly in front of Charging Bull. The statue was designed by Kristen Visbal and commissioned by State Street Global Advisers as part of a marketing campaign for their gender-diverse index fund. Fearless Girl was placed facing the bull, and seems to be staring it down</p>
